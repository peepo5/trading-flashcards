            ],
            "explanation": "FVG stands for Fair Value Gap. It is a gap in price delivery where price has an interest in returning to. It can prove useful for entries."

            ],
            "explanation": "OB (in ICT terms) stands for Orderblock. It is the last candle opposing a major move, and contains many one-sided orders. It can prove useful for entries."

                ["Common Bank Distribution Range", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "CBDR stands for Central Bank Dealing Range and it is the concept of a common price dealing range. The time of the range is 14:00-20:00EST (NY time) and it can prove useful to project the day's potential range."

                ["They are the same", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "A FVG (Fair Value Gap) is what is left of a partially explored Liquidity Void, so it is not the same concept."

                ["Yes, a new low has been created", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "If price wicks below a previous swing low, unless the body closes below it (and for more confirmation on a higher timeframe too) then this move would only count as a stop run, and it is not a BOS."

            ],
            "explanation": "OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) is a concept to determine whether price is in discount or premium within a range. OTE is typically between 0.618 and 0.79 on a fib retracement."

                ["0.5", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "The golden ratio is 1.618 but within a fib it is 0.618, sometimes rounded up to 0.62. This figure is useful as an OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) target or confluence."

                ["When bulls and bears agree to not buy", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "Equilibrium (also known as EQ) is when there is an equal interest for buyers and sellers within a market. This is Fair Market Value. It is also known as the 0.5 level in a fib because it is as equally discount as premium."
        },
        {

                ["When price invalidates an OB", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "A stop run is when price moves to a level where stops are placed in the market, to gather up orders to the sellside or buyside. Identifying these can be useful to frame market conditions."

            "difficulty": 1,

                ["A FVG", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "Liquidity Pools sound similar to Liquidity Voids, but they are the opposite. Liquidity Pools contain a large amount of liquidity, meaning price will likely have trouble passing them. Liquidity voids, on the other hand, are easy to pass."

                ["Reversal", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "The only move following a consolidation is an expansion move. This is because the market has collected orders within the consolidation (to prepare to prepare for the expansion)."
        },

            "difficulty": 2,
            "question": "How is a Retracement different from a Reversal?",

                ["A Retracement is when price moves down", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "A Retracement is when price moves back into a recently created price range, typically away from a PD Array (Like FVG, OB). Retracements typically move into or slightly past the range's Equilibrium level, which provides a potential trading setup."
        },

                ["When a Liquidity Void is filled", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "A Breaker is created when an Orderblock is violated. Orderblocks are ran through more on the side of the market to where the trend is heading. Breakers can be useful reference points for catching retracements and following expansions."

                ["LTF", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "The HTF (Higher Time Frame) holds more significance than lower time frames because it holds more liquidity and it also dictates trends over the mid and lower time frames."

                ["Never", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "Phantom trendlines can be used as potential targets for liquidity sweeps, due to retail stops. Even though they are useful, it is a good idea to use them mainly as a confluence rather than the sole trade idea."

                ["C (Below OB)", false]
            ],
            "explanation": "In this example, we can see the three higher high points all support each other until the major CHoCH (CHange of CHaracter). When the topmost swing low is taken out, the lowest (but not the OB) in the trend can be targeted. However, you could also trade partials in this setup!"

            "explanation": "The major institutional reference point circled here is the Liquidity Void. The answer is not an FVG because one has not been created yet. The answer is also not an Orderblock because it is not circled."

            "explanation": "The 1D, 4H and 15m are recommended as pairs for Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Analysis. The daily is needed to set the context, 4H for HTF (Higher Time Frame) reference points, 15m and optional 1m for scouting entries."

            ],
            "explanation": "Around 1% is the recommended amount of capital to risk per trade (if the trade stops out), because it is not too high to where losses are very damaging, but not too low to where compounding is slow."
